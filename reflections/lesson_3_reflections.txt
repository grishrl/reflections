When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working on multiple PCs or with mutliple contributors.  Or for secured back ups.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You would pull because git might overwrite your changes with newer or older code than you were ready for.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Forks are github server side copies
clones are client side copies
Branches are slpits in the code to makes specific changes

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You can easily see the difference between your changes and that is stored on git hub or what you started with.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Depends mostly on what sort of project, coding it has clear advantages but simpler files and project probably this would add to many extra steps to sharing and colaborating with files.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
So that you can initiate a pull to have your code added into the branch officially.  Branching provides control over a collaborative project and direct control to master branch gives 1 person complete control in solo situations
