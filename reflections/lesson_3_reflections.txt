When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When working on multiple PCs or with mutliple contributors.  Or for secured back ups.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
You would pull because git might overwrite your changes with newer or older code than you were ready for.
